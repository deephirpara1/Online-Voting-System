Copy the entire `voting System` folder to your XAMPP htdocs directory:
```
C:\xampp\htdocs\voting System\
```

### Step 2: Create the Database
1. Open **phpMyAdmin** at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
2. Click **Import** tab
3. Browse to `voting System/database/voting_system.sql`
4. Click **Go** to import

Or create manually:
1. Click **SQL** tab in phpMyAdmin
2. Copy the contents of `database/voting_system.sql`
3. Paste and click **Go**

### Step 3: Configure Database Connection

```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'voting_system');
define('DB_USER', 'root');
define('DB_PASS', '');  // Default XAMPP has no password
```

### Step 4: Access the Application

## Database Schema

### Tables
| Table        | Purpose                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `admins`     | Admin accounts                       |
| `voters`     | Voter accounts with status           |
| `elections`  | Elections with dates and status       |
| `candidates` | Candidates linked to elections       |
| `votes`      | Vote records with UNIQUE constraint  |
| `audit_logs` | Complete action audit trail          |

### Key Constraints
- `votes.UNIQUE(election_id, voter_id)` — prevents duplicate voting at DB level
- `candidates.election_id` → `elections.id` ON DELETE CASCADE
- `votes.candidate_id` → `candidates.id` ON DELETE CASCADE
- `elections.created_by` → `admins.id` ON DELETE SET NULL
